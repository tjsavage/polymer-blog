Exciting news! The [webcomponents.js polyfills](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) have officially been moved from the Polymer site and organization to [webcomponents.org](http://webcomponents.org/).

The Web Components polyfills were created to bring the awesomeness of Web Components to browsers that haven't yet implemented the API's natively.  Naturally, Polymer relies on these polyfills extensively and the team actively helps develop, maintain, and improve these polyfills.

As the Web Components community continues to grow, more and more libraries are coming to use the polyfills - Mozilla's [X-Tags](http://www.x-tags.org/) library uses the Custom Element and HTML Imports Polyfills, the [Bosonic](http://bosonic.github.io/) library uses Custom Elements, and a number of sites have cropped up that provide polyfills-as-a-service.

Unfortunately, we've also seen instances where developers conflate the Polymer library with the Web Components polyfills. The polyfills should unfettered and clear to use, to make it as easy as possible for developers to start building using Web Components.

To this end, webcomponents.org seemed clearly the correct place to house these polyfills going forward.  The Polymer team will continue to actively develop the polyfills, as part of the ever-strengthening Web Components community.

Check out the [new documentation on webcomponents.org](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/) and the [webcomopnentsjs repo](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs). Onward and upward!
